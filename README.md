This package provides an easy way to render custom HTML components in your Blade views.

Here's an example. Instead of this

```blade
<h1>My view</h1>

@include('myAlert', ['type' => 'error', 'message' => $message])
```

you can write this:

```blade
<h1>My view</h1>

<my-alert type="error" :message="$message" />
```

You can place the content of that alert in a simple Blade view that needs to be [registered](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-blade-x/v2/basic-usage/writing-your-first-component) before using the `my-alert` component.

```blade
{{-- resources/views/components/myAlert.blade.php --}}

<div class="{{ $type }}">
   {{ $message }}
</div>
```

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-blade-x
```

The package will automatically register itself.

## Documentation

You'll find the documentation on [https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-blade-x/v2/introduction](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-blade-x/v2/introduction).
